**Jupyter Notebook Collection**

This repository is a personal archive of Jupyter notebooks developed as part of ongoing academic learning and practical exploration in programming, data analysis, and applied statistics. The notebooks serve as a reflection of concepts practiced and problems solved using Python and associated data science libraries.

**About the Repository**

Each notebook is self-contained, well-structured, and annotated with markdown cells to explain the logic, methodology, and observations. The content spans a range of foundational and intermediate topics relevant to data-driven problem solving.

**Topics Covered**

Python scripting and control structures
Data manipulation using Pandas and NumPy
Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
Descriptive and inferential statistics
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Data cleaning and preprocessing workflows
Introductory machine learning exercises (where applicable)
Coursework, assignments, and independent practice notebooks

**Repository Structure**

The notebooks are organized thematically or chronologically depending on the nature of the work. Each file is named clearly for ease of navigation, and most include inline commentary to ensure clarity for reviewers or collaborators.

**Intended Audience**

This repository may be of interest to academic reviewers, potential collaborators, or recruiters looking to understand my technical foundation and problem-solving approach through practical implementations.

**Requirements**

Most notebooks rely on standard Python libraries including:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn (where applicable)
statsmodels

A standard Python environment (3.8+) with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed is sufficient to run these files.
